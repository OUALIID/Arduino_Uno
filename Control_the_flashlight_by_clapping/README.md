# Controlling Lamp with Applause

![Lamp Image](lamp_image.jpg)

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Redmi file! This project allows you to control a lamp using applause detected by a sound sensor. It's an exciting and interactive way to turn the lamp on and off effortlessly.

## Project Setup

To implement this project, you'll need the following components:
- Arduino board
- Sound sensor
- Lamp
- Wires for connections

## How It Works

The Arduino code reads data from the sound sensor, and when it detects applause or a loud sound, it triggers an action to toggle the lamp's state.

```cpp
int sensor_pin = 7;
int led = 6;
String led_status = "off";

void setup() {
    // Pin setup and initialization...
}

void loop() {
    // Main functionality to control the lamp...
}
